            Alice is quite close to her brother, Blur and it would be ideal for
            them to be adopted as a pair. However, where this is not possible,
            it would be best for Alice to go to a quiet and orderly home where
            she can rest and be at peace.

            Blur will need space for self-discovery, since he is still growing
            and finding out about himself. Since he is a fairly quiet and gentle
            little cat, he could fare well as a cat for young adults and older
            children.

            As one of the longest staying residents of the cafe (where 10 cats
            used to hold court before the Quarantine) it took us a while to
            realize that Asia really blossoms in places that have fewer cats.
            She may seem shy at first, but she enjoys being dressed up and
            showered with attention, like a true beauty queen!

            Looci is a healthy cat with no special requirements, asides from his
            need for plenty of love and attention. He may adjust to having other
            cats around, but would prefer to be a solo pet

            Shio learned to get along with the other cats at the Cattery by
            tagging along with Satoshi, despite Shio actually being a newer
            shelter resident. We think Heath would do well as an appurrentice to
            another cat.
